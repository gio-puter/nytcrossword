# NYT Crossword Answer & Clue LookUp

This project's goal was and is to create an easy lookup for the answers and clues of every NYT Crossword puzzle. I have done this mostly successfully (there's still some things that can be added) and can be accessed [here](https://nytcrossword.vercel.app). The website code is available here in the public and src folders. The api folder contains the serverless functions for Vercel to use. The vercel.json file contains the cron jobs for Vercel to handle.
